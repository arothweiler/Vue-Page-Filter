## Intro
----
This is my Vue project which I combined with my older Vue project. 
I've experimented a lot with Vuex, which is central store for your applications.

At the center of every Vuex application is the store. A "store" is basically a container that holds your application state. There are two things that make a Vuex store different from a plain global object >>> Vuex Documentation


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
